    			<h2>Hobbies Include:</h2>
    			<p> While I enjoy a wide variety of things, these are just a few of my favorite ways to spend time.</p>     	
          <div class="hobby-container">
           
            <div><img src="images/programming.jpg" style="width:304px;height:auto;"alt="Picture of Programmer Coding" class="image"></div>
            <div class="hobby"><h2>Computers &amp; Computer Programming</h2>
            <p><strong>Computer Programming</strong> is both my hobby and my passion. I do programming for a living, I play games, and I socialize online. Suffice it to say, I love computers! I am still nowhere near as proficient as I'd like to be but always strive to learn more every day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="hobby-container">
            <div><img src="images/hearts.jpeg" style="width:304px;height:auto;"alt="Picture of Herbal Plants" class="image"></div>
            <div class="hobby"><h2>Herbalism &amp; Herbal Medicine</h2>
            <p><strong>Herbal Medicine</strong> is both a new rage and an oldtime classic. Many modern medicines came from these ancient "folk" remedies that are still very valid today! From soaps, candles, and medicines to foods, cosmetics and dyes - there is always something new to do and try. It is best practice to learn your plants by their <em>Latin names</em> to help ensure safety so this is not a hobby for someone who just wants to play in the dirt! Always use reliable sources and harvest wisely!</p>

            <div><img src="images/library reader.jpg" style="width:304px;height:auto;" alt="Picture of a girl reading in stacks." class="image"></div>
            <div class="hobby"><h2>Reading &amp; Libraries</h2>
          <p>Libraries have changed a lot over the years. They are no longer the quiet sanctum of years goneby but a place for the <em>Community</em> to gather together. Most libraries offer computer classes, storytime for the kids, and a plethora of books! They also offer DVDs, music cds, and streaming serices. You can find books on every subject imaginable and always a friendly face to assist when you get "stuck" or just need a little extra help. All for the low low cost of a library card!</p>

            <div><img src="images/What-is-Crocheting.jpg" style="width:304px;height:auto;" alt="Picture of yarn." class="image"></div>
            <div class="hobby"><h2>Crocheting</h2> Crocheting is a quiet but focused hobby. It is very <em>relaxing</em>, however you'll need imagination and patience to turn a large chunk of yarn into something functional. You can make clothes, stuffed animals, household items and much much more. Definitely not "just for old ladies" anymore - men and women of all ages and walks of life enjoy this simple hobby.</p>
